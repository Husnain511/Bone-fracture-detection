# Bone-fracture-detection

## Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the detection of bone fractures in medical X-ray images. The model uses state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify and classify bone fractures, which can be a valuable tool for radiologists and healthcare professionals.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to assist medical professionals in diagnosing bone fractures more accurately and quickly. Automated fracture detection can reduce the workload of radiologists and help in providing timely and accurate diagnoses, ultimately improving patient care.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of medical X-ray images of various bone fractures. The dataset is not included in this repository due to licensing and privacy issues, but it can be obtained from [source URL](insert_source_URL_here).

## Model Architecture

We implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. The model architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. We trained the model on the provided dataset for a set number of epochs, optimizing it for accuracy.

For more details on the model architecture, please refer to the code in the `model.py` file.

## Requirements
